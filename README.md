# Equine Colic Analysis
## Description
This analysis has been conducted as part of the Udacity Datascience Nanodegree. The notebook uses pandas and an sklearn Linear Regression model to answer three questions:
- According to this dataset, what are the colic survival rates of younger horses compared to older horses ?
- Will colic surgery always save my horse's life ?
- Which of the vital signs or symptoms, that I can check as a horse owner, are the best indicators that my horse might require surgery 

The dataset has been sourced from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/horse-colic It contains typical equine colic symptoms as well as the outcome after the colic. For more information on the various features, refer to the data dictionary.

The project contains one CSV file (horse.csv) and a data dictionary that can can be found in this same rep (datadict.txt)

## Software and Libraries
This project will execute in a Jupyter notebook environment:
https://jupyter.org/

It uses pandas library:
https://pandas.pydata.org/

It also makes use of the following sklearn libraries:
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html

## Credits
I have repurposed a lot of code from the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree
